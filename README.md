üëã Welcome to the README file! You will find more information into the current repository with the purpose of this project and the features or functionalities I tried.

This code retrieves data from the Tor network and populates a database with it. It also allows users to search for a keyword on several search engines through a Tor proxy. This repository will be updated as soon as posible it has a live demo in this Onion address: `[http://like5dbbczvrnsa52vfw4zcifvobpdlx7hxzr3ley6tltaqdg3cqjtqd.onion/]`

üìÇ File Structure:

main.py: Main file containing Flask routes and functions to retrieve and populate data in the database.
templates/: Directory containing HTML templates for the web app.
  - index.html for browsing the tor network.
  - contact.html following the tor network this is a contact form tor network based with PGP.
static/: Directory containing CSS and JS files for the web app.
  - css 
  - img 
üìù Instructions:

Run main.py to start the Flask app.
Access the web app in your browser at http://localhost:5000/.
Enter a keyword to search for on the search engines.
The search results will be displayed on the page.
üì¶ Dependencies:

Flask: Web framework for Python.
stem: Python controller library for Tor.
sqlite3: Python library for SQLite database management.
flask_limiter: Flask extension for rate limiting.
ü§ñ Technologies:

Python
Flask
Tor

üöÄ Future Features and Improvements üåü

1Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Rating System: One potential future feature could be an improved rating system that incorporates more detailed user feedback, such as written reviews, and a more sophisticated algorithm for calculating overall ratings.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Indexing Database: Another possible improvement could be the development of a more robust indexing database that enables faster and more accurate search results. This could involve incorporating machine learning algorithms to better understand user queries and improve the relevance of search results.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Personalization: To enhance user engagement and satisfaction, the platform could incorporate personalized recommendations based on user preferences, search history, and behavior patterns. This could involve machine learning algorithms that learn from user data over time to provide more relevant and personalized content.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Collaboration Features: To support collaboration and teamwork, the platform could develop features such as real-time chat, document sharing, and project management tools. This could improve communication and productivity among users, particularly for those working remotely.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Voice and Image Search: To keep up with emerging technologies, the platform could incorporate voice and image search capabilities. This could involve integrating natural language processing and computer vision algorithms to enable users to search for content using voice commands or by uploading images.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Security: As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the platform could invest in enhanced security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This could include measures such as two-factor authentication, data encryption, and regular security audits.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Integration with Other Platforms: To increase user convenience and engagement, the platform could integrate with other popular platforms such as social media, messaging apps, and email clients. This could enable users to access platform content and features without having to leave their preferred apps.
